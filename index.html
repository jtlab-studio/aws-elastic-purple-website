                    <p class="about-text">
                        Elastic Purple exists at the intersection of cybersecurity and cloud technology, particularly AWS, 
                        combining experience in both blue and red teaming to anticipate and respond to threats. 
                        Over the past decade, work across data science and cybersecurity in on-premises and SaaS environments 
                        has highlighted the growing role of large language models hosted on cloud infrastructure, used by both 
                        legitimate and malicious actors. Recognising the need for scalable, 
                        flexible cloud solutions alongside structured security practices led to the creation of Elastic Purple.                    </p>

                            Significant time has been devoted to upskilling through hands-on projects and 
                            formal certifications, building on foundational knowledge in networking and 
                            full-stack development. Full-stack projects included developing a fitness analytics 
                            application in Python and JavaScript, integrating Strava and Garmin data, as well as 
                            topological and routing APIs, with Taipy used for data visualisation. Performance 
                            optimisation and language development were pursued by translating the Python application 
                            into Rust using Claude AI, achieving notable speed improvements, alongside creating a 
                            mobile app for direct metrics collection via built-in sensors.
